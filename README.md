# Discord AI Bot – Tool-Driven

An AI bot for Discord designed to act freely using various tools.  

## Key Patterns

- **Triggered by anything** – messages, voice activity, scheduled tasks…  
- **Tool-driven code** – the AI uses code and APIs as tools to act, instead of being constrained by pre-written scripts.  
- **Acts freely** – minimal constraints, sometimes too free.  
- **Natural behavior** – integrates seamlessly, reacts like a real user.  

> The focus is on giving the AI tools to solve problems, not writing code to control the AI.

## Development Approach

The bot is built with AI assistance, but developers remain in control.  

- AI helps write code, mostly in specific areas like tools.  
- Guidance is provided via structured files (like `AGENTS.md`) to ensure AI follows clear rules.  
- Human developers oversee everything to keep the project on track.
